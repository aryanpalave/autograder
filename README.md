# autograder

A script autograder.sh that “grades” solutions to a hypothetical homework assignment. It's given a set of students’ solution files, each of which is supposed to be named task1.sh (though some students used the wrong file name…), and the script will run each of them one at a time, examining the output to see if it matches the expected output.
